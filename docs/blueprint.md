## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant rose (#E91E63) evoking care and love, suitable for Mother's Day.
- Background color: A soft pale pink (#F8BBD0), visibly similar to the primary but much less saturated, creating a gentle and inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: A playful violet (#9C27B0), placed to the 'left' of rose on the color wheel, and provides a bright, energetic contrast.
- Font: 'Belleza', a sans-serif that brings an artistic feel well suited to promotional materials. Since text will likely only be a short phrase associated with an image, a single font will work well.
- Clean and simple layout, focusing on the form and generated image, using clear sections.
- Subtle animations on form submission and image generation to provide feedback.
